- Provide insights to optimize hotel pricing and marketing strategies.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and formatted date fields.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used descriptive statistics and visualizations.
3. **Data Visualization**: Analyzed trends using bar charts, histograms, and line plots.
4. **Feature Analysis**: Examined relationships between booking behavior and cancellations.

## Key Insights
- **Seasonality in Bookings**: August sees the highest bookings, while January is the least busy.
